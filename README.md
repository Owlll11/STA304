# starter_folder

This repo is about the project using dataset from the Toronto Open Data Portal to tell a story about data.

It is organised as follows, inputs folder includes the data and literature. In this project we directly imported the dataset from the `opendatatoronto` package, so we do not have the dataset in the data folder. The literature folder should contains the reference articles used in the project.
The outputs folder includes the .rmd file, the pdf, and the bibliography file.
The scripts folder contains the scripts which indicated some steps of the project.
